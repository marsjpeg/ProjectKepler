Aiming to teach astronomy facts.

## Description
Astronomy Discord bot (python-based) that provides users different facts using JSON and REST API's, mostly from NASA. I made the bot in order to spread more knowledge on astronomy to others interested, hoping to increase interest in space!

**main.py:** Runs the code. <br>
**bot.py:** The main chunk of the code; contains all embedded responses to user messages, functions for filtering out the JSON files, and extra unrelated commands that a user can type/use. <br>
**responses.py:** Responses that aren't formatted as embeds within the Discord app. <br>
